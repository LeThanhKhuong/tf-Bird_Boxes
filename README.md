Predicting Bounding Boxes

Welcome to Course 3, Week 1 Programming Assignment!

In this week's assignment, you'll build a model to predict bounding boxes around images.

    You will use transfer learning on any of the pre-trained models available in Keras.
    You'll be using the Caltech Birds - 2010 dataset.
